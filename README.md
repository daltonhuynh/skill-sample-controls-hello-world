This skill gets you started with basic “Hello World” functionality and rapidly generating a voice response from Alexa using the ASK SDK Controls framework.

## Skill Architecture
Each skill consists of two basic parts, a front end and a back end.
The front end is the voice interface, or VUI.
The voice interface is configured through the voice interaction model.
The back end is where the logic of your skill resides.

## Skill Setup

[Install the ASK CLI](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/smapi/quick-start-alexa-skills-kit-command-line-interface.html) and then follow the [ASK CLI instructions](./instructions/cli.md) to set up this skill.
